  "description": "The doctor of etiquettes and mannerisms.\n\nHis knowledge is impeccable. His chain in the Qur’an is only 28 shy of the Prophet, on whom be peace. His demeanour is utterly disarming. His style in fashion and stride in walk make you say, “That man is fit to be president.”\n\nShaykh Mohammed is completely a different class. He melts the hearts with lessons in tazkiyah, akhlaq, self-discovery, and psychology—and above all, a great humility that befits a true scholar.\n\nShaykh Mohammed traces his roots back to the ancient city of Harar in the Horn of Africa. Originally from Yemen, his forefathers immigrated to East Africa and played a central role in the Islamic history of the region.\n\nHe completed a BA in Islamic Studies from the Institute of Islamic and Arabic Sciences in America in Fairfax, Virginia, and graduated in Qur’an Memorization and Recitation from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He was the Imam at the Islamic Community Center of Laurel in Laurel, Maryland, and at the Islamic Center of San Diego in San Diego, California.\n\nHe currently serves as the Imam at the Islamic Institute of Orange County, otherwise known as Masjid Omar Farouk."
