  "description": "Head of our Qur’an and Hadeeth Sciences Department.\n\nSurprising to our students, Shaykh Ahsan is actually among our youngest instructors; his calm demeanour, mature attitude, and advanced knowledge cause us to assume otherwise.\n\nBorn and bred in Birmingham, United Kingdom, he is well known in his community as the young Qari who memorised the Qur’an at the tender age of 13 and who delivered regular halaqaat in Birmingham.\n\nIn 2000, he gained a scholarship to enter the Islamic University of Madinah. After completing his Arabic diploma, he graduated from the Faculty of Shari‘ah in 2006 with honours. He obtained ijazah in the Qur’an as well as studied under a number of well-known scholars, such as Shaykh Abdul Muhsin Al-Abbad and Shaykh Muhammad ibn Muhammad Mukhtar Al-Shinqiti. Shaykh Ahsan also recently completed his PhD in Islamic Law from the University of Birmingham.\n\nKnown for his unique Britishness, and love for sweet things, he has taken the AlMaghrib world by storm!"
