There is probably nobody better than him to understand the plight of Muslim youth in the face of today’s pop culture pressures.\n\nShaykh Saad studied Art History, Modern Art, Graphic Design, and Psychology at the University of Maryland. He started his Islamic education at the Institute of Islamic and Arabic Sciences in America in Fairfax, Virginia. He then went on to study in the Islamic University of Madinah, where he dedicated himself to the study of Islamic Sciences. He graduated with a Bachelor’s from the Faculty of Shari‘ah, University of Madinah."
