As an AlMaghrib instructor, he teaches the hugely popular “Behind the Scenes” seminar, which focuses on the strengthening of the soul and disciplining the nafs.\n\nHis journey of seeking knowledge started in 2000 in the United Arab Emirates, where he spent a few years at the feet of prestigious scholars, such as Shaykh Tariq Ibn Rajah and Amr Al-Sheshany. Since then, he has sought knowledge and studied under Shaykh Salah As-Sawy, Dr Hatem Al- Haj, his father-in-law Shaykh Abul Abed, and Al-Allamah Shaykh Omar Al-Ashqar (rahimahullah).\n\nShaykh Omar has two Bachelor’s degrees, in Islamic Studies and in Accounting, and a Master’s degree in Islamic Finance. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Islamic Studies from the International Islamic University of Malaysia.\n\nHe previously served as the Imam for Masjid Abu Bakr As-Siddique in New Orleans for 6 years and has since dedicated himself to full-time teaching. He has taught with Mishkah University (formerly Sharia Academy) since 2008 under Shaykh Salah As-Sawy and currently serves as the Director of the Islamic Learning Foundation in Texas, as well as being the resident scholar at Valley Ranch Islamic Centre.\n\nShaykh Omar is also a strong advocate of community service, interfaith dialogue, and social justice. He served as the field coordinator of Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA) Relief in Hurricane Katrina and also co-founded the East Jefferson Clergy Interfaith Council.
