  "name": "Abu Eesa Niamatullah",
  "role": "Editor in Chief",
  "city": "Manchester, UK",
  "description": "A show by himself! Original, addictive, and with an unparalleled (and extremely dark!) sense of humour.\n\nShaykh Abu Eesa (universally known as “AE”) combines experience, ‘ilm, and a modern understanding and application that is unique and utterly relevant. Don’t be fooled by his jocular exterior—it is unsurprising just how treasured he is to our student body as one of our most passionate and knowledgeable senior instructors.\n\nBorn in London, England, he tracks his roots to the Naser Kheil tribe of the North West Frontier in Pakistan. He studied both Pharmacy at the University of Manchester and then Anthropology, and then later he studied Arabic, Islamic Law, and the Qur’an with its memorization from scholars in a diverse array of locations. Shaykh Muhammad Salim ‘Abdul Wadud Al-Shanqiti (rahimahullah), Mufti Taqi Al-Usmani, Shaykh Abdullah Al-Judai’, and Shaykh Kehlan Al-Jubury count from amongst his many teachers, leading to a real variety of experiences and depth in the Islamic Sciences, which are so famously expressed in Shaykh Abu Eesa’s multi-dimensional da’wah and teachings.\n\nShaykh Abu Eesa previously served as the Resident Scholar of Cheadle Masjid in South Manchester, yet he still continues to teach Fiqh weekly there as part of our onsite plus online initiative known as “Logical Progression”. He was the previous Resident Scholar of the 1st Ethical Charitable Trust in Bolton, an organization dedicated to civic engagement and Islamic legal and financial education. He was the original founder of “Prophetic Guidance” (PG) and still remains as the main teacher presenting PG’s classes and events such as the famous “Last Testament” play; his popular commentary to “Al-Adab Al-Mufrad” class is still aired today on Islamic TV channels."
